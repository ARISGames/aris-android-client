### 9/29/2016: Most Game Features are Working; Some Still to be Completed
  The ARIS Android app code is substantially complete. It is capable of loading and playing most
  games with fairly straightforward common requirements including, maps, items, plaques, dialogs,
  and web page views. Scanner, Decoder and Notebook tabs are stubbed in but not functional. the Quests
  tab is in place, but not tested. Sound media does not appear to be working.

  At this point the app is quite runnable, again, for simple game demonstrations, but do note that
  very little QA has been applied to this very raw collection of source code, and there WILL be bugs.

  Please feel free to test to your heart's content and send feedback on bugs, missing features,
  strange behaviors, etc.


### 11/10/2015: initial push to GitHub of this project.
  The code is runnable without crashing, but is far from complete. Presently it presents all the 
  essential screens for logging in, selecting a game and initiating the start of game play; from this
  screen on, there are only stubs of what will be the game play fragments.
